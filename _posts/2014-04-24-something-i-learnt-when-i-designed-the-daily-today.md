## Iteration, and iteration

I have been working at The Daily, the student newspaper at the University of Washington for more than 4 months now. But I have been presented a design challenge - a new section called "Beer To The Streets"(which later renamed to "Hops, Sip and a Chug") is added this quarter, and the Arts & Leisure editor, Andre and I have been figuring out about the design and layout for the past few weeks.<br>

Below is the screenshot in InDesign for the section that I designed last week. I took an info visualization approach because I want to make the facts and information eye catching for readers. And yeah, it turned out there's some Microsoft agenda when I was designing it :)<br>

{% include image.html url="/media/2014-04-24-something-i-learnt-when-i-designed-the-daily-today/0417.jpg" width="100%" description="Hops, Sip and a Chug beer section I desgined last week, which was published on April 18th." %}

The design was well-accepted according to Andre. But we need to create a new logo this week in addition of last week's design. Initially I had an idea of having the title to become a graphics block at the left side bar of the section, but there's more space on the top so I shifted it to become the top header.

I was having a weird feeling about the design. The title looks like paper cut magazine style and it doesn't really suit the beer context. I had an inspiration from a picture on Pinterest that has artsy and letter-type fonts. Andrew recommended that I download some types from [LostType](http://www.losttype.com/), but then I raised the concern of commercial use license since The Daily is a for-profit organization. We resorted to use [Aw Conqueror from Typofonderie](https://typofonderie.com/fonts/aw-conqueror-family/), which is an awesome font with various styles, and it's free and for commercial use.

After this was done, Andre raised the concern about the current design not having the title and info visualization matches together, because one has a grungy background and the other one is more of a flat design. In his opinion, last week's design has blended the title and the facts well. I listened to the feedback, agreed and decided that it's better to have a consistent design - it's either the background header has to be flat design, or the info blocks have to get the grungy background. I like the first option, so I changed the background and the font, and this is how it looks like for final design:

I was working there for more than 3 hours, which is way overtime than I am supposed to be. But I am documenting this because I have learnt something useful this evening. More iterations are going to come for the next few weeks, but I am happy how the design turned out - the consistent flat design throughout the section and the color scheme that match well together.
