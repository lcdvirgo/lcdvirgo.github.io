## Hello World!

No, this is not a typical default hello world post on some Wordpress blog.

I have successfully installed [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)! And deployed it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I came across [Karan's blog](http://karan.github.io) and he told me the site is using Jekyll. I have been struggling to decide whether I should have my blog on Wordpress/Jekyll/Medium/[Svbtle](https://svbtle.com)(I will write about on a new post some other time), but what really pushed me to start this Jekyll blog is because I stumbled across [this beautiful theme I could use](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/thinny) from [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/).

I have problem installing Xcode Command Line Tools on my computer.
